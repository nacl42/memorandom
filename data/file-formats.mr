 What is XML? The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple text-based format
 for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books,
 transactions, invoices, and much more. It was derived from an older standard
 format called SGML (ISO 8879), in order to be more suitable for Web use.

 <person id="Alice">
    <name>Alice</name>
    <surname>Foo</surname>
 </person>

 .label comma-separated-values

 @file-format Rec

 .doc>
  GNU recutils is a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable,
  text-based databases called recfiles. The data is stored as a sequence of
  records, each record containing an arbitrary number of named fields. Advanced
  capabilities usually found in other data storage systems are supported: data
  types, data integrity (keys, mandatory fields, etc.) as well as the ability of
  records to refer to other records (sort of foreign keys). Despite its
  simplicity, recfiles can be used to store medium-sized databases.
